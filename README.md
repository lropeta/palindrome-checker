# Palindrome Checker

This repository contains a simple web application that allows users to check if a given string is a palindrome or not. 

## Features
- Users can enter a string into the input field.
- The application will then determine whether the entered string is a palindrome or not.
- The result will be displayed to the user indicating whether the string is a palindrome or not.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/lropeta/palindrome-checker.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How it Works
The application checks if the input string reads the same forwards and backwards. If it does, it is considered a palindrome. The application uses JavaScript to compare characters in the string to determine if it is a palindrome or not.
